# Rocket-Nozzle

The nozzle is the most crucial part of the rocket. It has to be designed for optimum efficiency to avoid wall wastage due to over-expansion and energy wastage due to under-expansion. In this project, we have a method based on the theory of characteristics presented for 2-D, supersonic nozzle design. The minimum length of the supersonic nozzle has been calculated for the optimum Mach number at the nozzle exit with the uniform flow at the diverging section of the nozzle by developing a MATLAB program.
